# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements HTTP Expires headers for static assets to improve website performance through browser caching. By setting appropriate cache expiration times for different types of static resources (CSS, JavaScript, images), we can reduce server load and improve page load times for returning visitors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want static assets to be cached by my browser, so that subsequent page loads are faster and consume less bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests CSS files THEN the server SHALL return an Expires header set to 1 year in the future
2. WHEN a user requests JavaScript files THEN the server SHALL return an Expires header set to 1 year in the future
3. WHEN a user requests image files (webp, svg, ico, webm) THEN the server SHALL return an Expires header set to 1 month in the future
4. WHEN a user requests the main HTML file THEN the server SHALL return an Expires header set to 1 hour in the future

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure cache expiration times for different asset types, so that I can balance performance with content freshness requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring cache headers THEN the system SHALL support different expiration times for different file types
2. WHEN assets are updated THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to invalidate cached versions
3. IF an asset has a version parameter or hash THEN the system SHALL allow longer cache times

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to ensure proper cache control headers are set, so that my website performs optimally across different browsers and CDNs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving static assets THEN the server SHALL include both Expires and Cache-Control headers for maximum compatibility
2. WHEN serving assets THEN the server SHALL include appropriate ETag headers for cache validation
3. IF a browser sends an If-Modified-Since header THEN the server SHALL respond with 304 Not Modified when appropriate
